Supabase + Drizzle Embeddings Test Document

This is a sample text file created to test an automated ingestion pipeline
that uploads files to Supabase Storage and generates vector embeddings
using OpenAI.

The pipeline works as follows:
1. A file is uploaded to Supabase Storage.
2. A database trigger fires when the upload completes.
3. A Supabase Edge Function is invoked automatically.
4. The function extracts text from the uploaded file.
5. The text is split into smaller chunks.
6. Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding.
7. The embeddings are stored in PostgreSQL using pgvector.

This system supports semantic search, retrieval augmented generation (RAG),
and intelligent document querying.

Key technologies involved:
- Supabase Storage for file uploads
- Supabase Edge Functions running on Deno
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database access
- OpenAI embedding models via AI SDK

Use cases for this pipeline include:
- Knowledge base indexing
- Chatbots with document awareness
- Semantic search across uploaded files
- Automated document processing workflows

If this text appears in the database with an associated embedding,
the ingestion pipeline is working correctly.
